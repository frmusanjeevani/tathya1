Create a structured field list for capturing, processing, and closing Internal Fraud cases involving employees. Fields should be logically grouped according to process flow and role responsibilities. Apply field restrictions, conditions for mandatory inputs, and define role-based edit/view rights. This should be a dedicated, separate page that is not reflected anywhere else inside Investigation for Tatya Lab, and it should be embedded on the login page alongside Investigation and Tatya Lab as an independent module.

Layout & Element Rules
Do not change or reposition the logo section or page header.

Keep the left navigation panel untouched.

Maintain spacing, alignment, and form flow as per current layout.

Remove or hide unnecessary boxes or empty placeholders.

If a box is invisible due to matching background, keep it invisible or remove it (do not make it visible with colors).

Consistency Requirements
Apply the blue theme only to this page’s relevant interactive or content-focused elements (buttons, tabs, form fields, section headers).

Preserve the page’s functional visual hierarchy.

Avoid adding extra borders, heavy shadows, or over-styling intentionally minimal areas.
