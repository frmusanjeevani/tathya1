Cautiously follow the instructions and avoid using your own additions.
Since there are multiple changes to be done, this is the first step to be followed.

We are updating the Project Tathya Case Entry module to include a new Case Type selector and a dynamic Case Details section. This enhancement should:

Display Case Type as a single-select drop-down with the following values:

Fraud Suspect

Customer Complaint

Internal Escalation

Legal Referral

Credential Misuse

Branch Escalation

Third-Party Alert

Social Media Flag

Call Center Escalation

Audit Observation

EWS – Early Warning Signal

Other (Specify)

Add a Case Details section that is dynamically displayed based on the selected Case Type.

Each Case Type should trigger its corresponding Case Details fields as per the mapping below:

Case Type → Case Details Fields:

Fraud Suspect → Suspected Fraud Modus Operandi, Source of Suspicion, Initial Loss Estimate

Customer Complaint → Complaint Nature, Customer Statement Summary, Date of Incident

Internal Escalation → Escalation Source, Escalation Reason, Related Department

Legal Referral → Law Enforcement Agency, FIR/Case Number, Date of Referral

Credential Misuse → Type of Credentials Misused, Method of Compromise, Date Detected

Branch Escalation → Branch Name/Code, Escalation Trigger, Responsible Officer

Third-Party Alert → Source Entity, Alert Type, Date of Alert

Social Media Flag → Platform, Post/Content Link, Date Posted

Call Center Escalation → Call ID/Reference, Escalation Reason, Date of Call

Audit Observation → Audit Type, Observation Summary, Audit Date

EWS – Early Warning Signal → Signal Type, Trigger Source, Observation Date

Other (Specify) → Description, Source, Date Noted

Requirements:

Field labels and data types must match the above exactly.

Case Details section should appear immediately upon Case Type selection without page reload.

Ensure database schema is updated to store these new fields, with nulls allowed for non-applicable fields.

Ensure all API endpoints that handle Case Entry are updated to handle the new Case Type and Case Details fields.

Update reporting and search filters to allow filtering by both Case Type and Case Details fields.

Changes must be tested end-to-end for data integrity, UI behaviour, and API functionality.
